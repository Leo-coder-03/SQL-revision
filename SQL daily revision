1. Display all the allergies ordering them in descending order based on their popularity, also avoid null.
SELECT DISTINCT(allergies),COUNT(*) as total_diagnosis FROM patients WHERE allergies IS NOT NULL  GROUP BY allergies ORDER BY total_diagnosis DESC; 

2.Show all patient's first_name, last_name, and birth_date who were born in the 1970s decade. Sort the list starting from the earliest birth_date.
SELECT first_name,last_name,birth_date FROM patients WHERE year(birth_date) BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979 ORDER BY birth_date ASC;

3.We want to display each patient's full name in a single column. Their last_name in all upper letters must appear first, then first_name in all lower case letters. Separate the last_name and first_name with a comma. Order the list by the first_name in decending order
SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(last_name) , ',',LOWER(first_name)) FROM patients ORDER BY first_name DESC;

4. Show the province_id(s), sum of height; where the total sum of its patient's height is greater than or equal to 7,000.
SELECT province_id , SUM(height) FROM patients GROUP BY province_id HAVING SUM(height) >= 7000;(We use having with agggregate methods)
